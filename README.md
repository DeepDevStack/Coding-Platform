# Code Evaluator - React Web App

## 📖 Project Description

Code Evaluator is a frontend React-based coding platform designed to help users write, execute, and test their code for algorithmic problems. It provides an interactive environment with a built-in code editor, real-time execution capabilities, and a structured problem statement panel. The platform aims to enhance coding practice by offering language selection, custom input handling, and an AI-driven evaluation system in future iterations.

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a foundation for a full-fledged coding platform that will eventually integrate AI-based code evaluation and backend execution support. It is inspired by platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank, aiming to provide a seamless coding experience directly from the browser.
